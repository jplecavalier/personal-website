# About me

I am a senior actuarial analyst at Intact DataLab and lecturer at the École d'actuariat de l'Université Laval. I am an associate of the Casualty Actuarial Society and of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries. I'm pursuing my exams with the objective of becoming a fellow of these two institutions. I am also studying under the supervision of the professor Thierry Duchesne of the Université Laval to obtain a master degree in statistics.

I like to say that it's my love for mathematics that brought me towards the actuarial field and that this same actuarial field since brings me to cheat on mathematics with computer programming, my new flame. I try to work the most as I can with open-source softwares and to get involved in communities developed around these softwares. For me, nothing in the world is more valuable than sharing my knowledge with those other community members with the same passion.

During my free time, I like to play the piano and to write. In fact, I always believed that writing was the best way to structure my thoughts.
