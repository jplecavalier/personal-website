<p>I’m sure I’m not the only one out there who was very enthusiastic when the National Hockey League
(NHL) <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-teams-in-new-divisions-for-2020-21-season/c-319844882">unveiled its newly reshuffled divisions</a>
ahead of the 2021 season. I was secretly dreaming of an all-Canadian division for a long time, but
never I thought that this dream could ever materialize. We’re entitled to expect electrifying
hockey for the upcoming season, and some rivalries will certainly reach a higher, more emotional
level, but what about the effect of this reshuffling on team traveling?</p>

<p>This post is the first of a series in which I will explore and explain different features of the
<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> package <a href="https://jplecavalier.github.io/tidynhl/"><code>tidynhl</code></a>, a
personal project that is slowly but surely taking shape. The purpose of this package is to give
access to NHL data by facilitating the interaction with their open stats API, and to provide this
data on a ready-to-use and clean (or tidy) format.</p>
<div id="team-schedules-for-the-2021-season" class="section level2">
<h2>Team schedules for the 2021 season</h2>
<p>To begin, let’s get and print an excerpt of the NHL 2021 schedule with the <code>tidy_schedules()</code>
function.</p>

a later section of the post.</p>

<p>Then, we create another different table in which we will compute distances between any pair of team
venues. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll make the hypothesis that distances are calculated as the
crow flies. The <a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/geosphere/"><code>geosphere</code></a> package provides an
easy way to perform this with the <code>distm()</code> function.</p>
<p>In the chunk below, we will first retrieve metadata for each team (two of which are their venue’s
geographic coordinates and their actual division) using the <code>tidy_teams_meta()</code> function. We’ll then
compute a distance matrix as specified earlier and reorganize it as a table to make an eventual
merge easier.</p>

<h2>Travel analysis</h2>
<p>Before going any further, we need to assume additional hypothesis regarding travel habits of teams.
Of course, it’s impossible to have a perfect one-size-fits-all model, but I tried to rightly managed
the required trade-off between simplicity and reality when designing the algorithm.</p>
<p>We will then assume the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each team is located home at the beginning of the season,</li>
<li>Trips abroad follow the algorithm below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="figs-en/algo-travel.png" /></p>
<p>To make sure it is well understood, we can apply the algorithm to the first few games of the
<a href="https://www.nhl.com/en/canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> and analyze the result. For the first two
weeks of the season, the resulting travels for the Habs are listed below:</p>

<p>As one may probably have guessed right, the three teams in the New York Metropolitan Area (NYR, NYI
and NJD) are those who will travel on the shortest distance for the season. Teams in the
all-Canadian division are those that, in average, will travel on the greatest distance. However, one
could observe that the distribution within this division is rather uniform, which is not the case
for the Western division. Indeed, while the Anaheim Ducks will only need to travel a slight more
than 17,000 km over the course of the season, the St. Louis Blues will accumulate just short of
35,000 km (more than twice <span class="emoji">😱</span>!) on the same period. We’ll see if
that competitive advantage for the Ducks will prove enough to overcome their obvious lack of
offensive skills…</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/RNEGEAUjnQvzGRiCza/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>One thing is sure, if the accumulated tiredness coming from traveling during the season is an
important factor on player performances in playoffs, teams from the Eastern division will have a
major headstart when playing other teams this spring.</p>

<p>There is no surprise in observing that the mini-series concept, in which two teams play successive
games one agaist the other, does reduce the traveling distance for all and every teams. The big
winners of this reshuffling are indisputably the Eastern division teams while those experiencing the
most modest gains (yet still interesting) are mainly the Canadian teams. That being said, I forever
am a mad Montreal Canadiens fan, and the most important thing of all for me is to see the Leafs
(agin and again) proudly sitting in the last position of whatever ranking there is
<span class="emoji">😁</span>.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even though this post highlighted the traveling asymmetries created by the reshuffling of the NHL
divisions, it still remains difficult to predict wether all of this will have a significant impact
on the ice or not. The season promise to offer its share of unpredictable surprises, with some of
them having probably even greater consequences at the end. Moreover, it’s important to remember that
the schedule presented in this post is up-to-date as of today, but is very likely to change with
little notice with COVID-19 local outbreaks. After all, there is not much we can do more than to
wait and see, and of course, enjoy the show!</p>
